# Reflection

# What was the most helpful aspect of this code's structure?
Most helpful aspect was the clear seperation of concerns. Each function has a single specific job
to calculate the total, handle the frequency, and handle the display. This allows the different
parts to be debugged easier and the rest of the script is not affected.

# What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
The function called 'mostReadBook' was the longest because it was a large amount of code
to study.  Two types of loops were used which were new to me. First, the 'for...of' loop builds an
object (I called it the frequency map) and also the 'for...in' loop which iterates through that
object's keys to find the highest value.  I wanted to understand how to use the array and the
object's keys.  This was a pretty difficult program but I was able to look at it closer to become
more familiar with javascript.
